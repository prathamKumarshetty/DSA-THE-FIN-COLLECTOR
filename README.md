# Debtor Management System

Welcome to the Debtor Management System! This project is designed to efficiently manage debtor details, agent details, and the process of debt collection through a combination of data structures and algorithms.

## Features

- **Debtor and Agent Management:** Store and manage debtor and agent details using structured data.
- **Debt Collection Process:** Implement an effective debt collection process using algorithms.
- **Interest Calculation:** Calculate interest on debts based on the current date.
- **Shortest Path Algorithm:** Optimize the debt collection path using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
- **Chain Hashing:** Efficiently store and retrieve agent details using chain hashing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/debtor-management-system.git
cd debtor-management-system
```

## Building the Project
To build the project, run:

```bash
make
```
##Running the Project
After building the project, execute the program:

```bash
./debtor_management
```

## Usage
### Logging In
1. Start the application.
2. Enter your UserID and password to log in as an agent.
### Managing Debtors
1. Interest Calculation: Automatically calculate the interest for all debtors.
2. Debt Collection: Collect debts from the debtors and update their status in the system.
### Algorithms
1. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: Used for finding the shortest path between debtors' locations.
2. Chain Hashing: Used for efficiently storing and retrieving agent details.
### Data Structures
1. Debtor Structure: Stores debtor details.
2. Agent Structure: Stores agent details.
3. Binary Search Tree (BST): Used for managing debtors who have paid.
4. Linked List: Used for chain hashing in the agent details.
